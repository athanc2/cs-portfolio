    <h1>How to: Art</h1>
    <h2>For this project I made a Waffle.</h2>
    <p><small>I got this idea because I was hungry.</small></p>
    <p>The specifics of the code are loops, drawFunction and if/else. </p>
    <p>I used a for loop for the squares. It loops all the squares and makes this and this looks like a waffle.<img style="margin-left: 20px; width:100px; height:100px;" src="squares.png"></p>  
    <p style="margin-top:50px">I used 2 draw functions, 1 is called drawSyrup and another one is called drawEat. I put the drawSyrup function in the mouseDragged function so that when I drag with my mouse it will drawSyrup and it looks like this.<img style="margin-left: 20px; width:100px; height:100px;" src="syrup.png"></p>
    <p>The other draw function called drawEat, I put in my mouseClicked function so when I click on the waffle it will eat it. (It makes a white circle)<img style="margin-left: 20px; width:100px; height:100px;" src="eat.png"></p>
    <p>I put mouseX>200 in my if/else function, if your mouse pass 200x it will change to something else, I made to change to a rectange instead of circle.<img style=" margin-left:10px; width:100px; height:100px;" src="rect.png"></p>
    <p>In this project I learnt a lot about javascript,</p>
